# Ideas for Features and Time Management Methods

I have evolved a generic time management system over the past decade or so. It continues to evolve in ways that refine not only my tools but my routines and methods of focus. This document operates as a sort of brainstorming journal, a living document. It tracks my thoughts and habits and ways I am scheming to get focused and productive while having fun.

## Quick Thoughts

The quick thoughts section is just that. A place to track down any spurious or suspicious idea without the need to throw the idea into any structure or preset form. Let them flow!

### On Daily Scheduling

Lately I have struggled in tracking all the relevant tasks, maintaining that list, prioritizing, and coordinating the various levels of visualizations, daily scheduling, daily time tracking, and in a way that minimizes effort. The quick idea I have right now is that one key challenge is a task tree, or as I like to call it, brick tree, seems to be the best way to track tasks for my brain. Every task is something that becomes a brick in this edifice of life I'm creating and is attached to some higher level objective of value. In this way, I can be assured that I'm doing things that are important.

One challenge though is that when it comes to daily scheduling there are so many important tasks and I need a view that will allow me to schedule them for the day. My current method though doesn't create objects per tasks and as such can't easily move tasks into daily lists. One idea is to transition to the tasks on time object model and then create an interface to be able to place a brick into a daily schedule like view. But, my current tasks scheduling method takes advantage of plain text, making it infinitely easy to use.

How to integrate the two so that I can easily do both? Would it make sense to use a file per brick? This way I have a handle that can then be inserted anywhere. The problem with this method is that it eliminates a single unified view of the brick tree with appropriately details and depth.

Once solution for that problem is to use a GUI tool that can *inline* a file, such as obsidian.md. I want to avoid forcing a particular viewer to make sense of the file though.

More to come...

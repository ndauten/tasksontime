# Philosophy

I have ADHD. Or at least the symptoms of it. :D. My journey of habits began very early in life. Always misplacing things. Always bored. It really started hampering school when, in the sixth grade, I pulled my first late night last minute massive project. I guess the thrill never left. Since then I've made many gaffs both public and private and learned many of the intricate ways to focus and conquer my brain. This document serves to detail a few of these as it relates to time management and how that manifests in the tasks on time suite.

In an effort to start conquering my perfectionist tendencies, where perfect is the enemy of good, I am going to *stub* this document as I see it now with the goal of slowly filling in as time goes on. Cheers!
